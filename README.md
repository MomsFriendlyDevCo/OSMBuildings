===============================
[Mom's Friendly Dev Co](http://mfdc.biz) fork of [OSMBuildings](https://github.com/OSMBuildings/OSMBuildings).

This repo is really just a series of monkey-patches to fix styling issues in the upstream fork.

All patch sets are prefixed with `MFDC:` which should be preserved on an upstream merge.
